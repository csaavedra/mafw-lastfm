mafw-lastfm
-----------

mafw-lastfm is a small daemon that scrobbles your listening habits to last.fm.

setting up
----------

As of mafw-lastfm 0.0.2 a control panel applet for Maemo is available. In order
to set up mafw-lastfm, simply access Settings -> Last.fm settings.

Alternatively, you can create a file $HOME/.osso/mafw-lastfm with the
following contents:

       [Credentials]
       username=[your lastfm username]
       password=[a md5sum of your lastfm password]

For instance, for a user named 'jamesthehacker' with password 'james':

	[Credentials]
	username=jamesthehacker
	password=b4cc344d25a2efe540adbf2678e2304c

To generate the md5sum of your password, you can simply run

   $ echo -n password | md5sum
