mafw-lastfm
-----------

mafw-lastfm is a small daemon that scrobbles your listening habits to last.fm.

setting up
----------

Create a file $HOME/.mafw-lastfm with the following contents:

       [Credentials]
       username=[your lastfm username]
       password=[a md5sum of your lastfm password]

For instance, for a user named 'jamesthehacker' with password 'james':

	[Credentials]
	username=jamesthehacker
	password=b4cc344d25a2efe540adbf2678e2304c

To generate the md5sum of your password, you can simply run

   $ echo password | md5sum

limitations
-----------

mafw-lastfm is in an early stage and has plenty of limitations:

- Songs are not serialized, so you'll loose the tracks you've listened if you restart
  the daemon.
- Pausing a track will still scrobble it. Resuming it will likely scrobble it again.

These features will come with time.
